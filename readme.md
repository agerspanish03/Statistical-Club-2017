# Statistical-Club-2017
This is for the Statistical Club (AI session and group project) in 2017!!

The goal is to predict the survival based on the Titanic data.
For the first par, I did some exploratory data analysis to see the relationship of variables and the target variable (i.e. Survival) .
The second part, I chose variables that I think most relevant to the survival and used KNN and logistic regression for prediction. I divided data into training and testing set and did n-fold cross-validation to see which parameter produce the best result. Finally, using simulation to see the model performance, and it turned out that logistic regression has much better accuracy (area under curve) than that of KNN model.
